    "## Conditional Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "<i>Conditional statements</i> are chunks of code that will run, depending on the truth value of some logical statement. Let's look at a dumb joke for a nice example,\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<blockquote>\n",
    "A woman sends her partner, who is a computer programmer, to the grocery store, she tells them:\n",
    "\n",
    "'I need butter, sugar and cooking oil. Also, get a loaf of bread and <i>if they have eggs</i>, get 6.'\n",
    "\n",
    "The partner returns with the butter, sugar and cooking oil, as well as 6 loaves of bread.\n",
    "\n",
    "The woman asks: 'Why the heck did you get 6 loaves of bread?'\n",
    "\n",
    "To which the partner replies: 'They had eggs.'\n",
    "</blockquote>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this dumb example, the conditional statement was <i>if they have eggs</i>, because it was `True`, the programmer executed the command <i>get 6</i>. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a general conditional statement you program a logical check that executes one bit of code if it is true and another if it is false.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional statements are denoted with `if`s and `else`s.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `if` Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "An `if` statement checks to see if the logical is `True` and if it is, it executes the code that follows. (The documentation for `if` can be found here <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#if-statements\">https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#if-statements</a>.)\n",
    "\n",
    "These typically use standard math operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "A reminder:\n",
    "- `a == b` checks if `a` is equal to `b`\n",
    "- `a != b` checks if `a` is not equal to `b`\n",
    "- `a < b` checks if `a` is less than `b`\n",
    "- `a <= b` checks if `a` is less than or equal to `b`\n",
    "- `a > b` checks if `a` is greater than `b`\n",
